- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance makes programming faster, because I don't have to repeat as much code

The House and Cafe classes worked pretty much immmmediately, working out how to use Hashtables took a while. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to read the entire java documentation for Hashtables before starting on Library, because that would have saved me a lot of time.
